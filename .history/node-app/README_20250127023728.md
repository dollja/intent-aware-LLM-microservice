# Multi-level intent-aware LLM
A multi-level intent-aware LLM responses that uses Theory of Mind to anticipate how its decisions and actions will affect human rapport  levels. The model integrates appraisal theory to assess the significance of these actions within the context of the team's goals and then adapts its behavior to enable the integration of individual mental states into collective, coherent views and decisions.

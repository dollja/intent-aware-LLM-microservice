The coherent views and decisions that emerge within groups are often unexpected and require explanation. There are a few key reasons why this is the case:
1. Individual differences:
 - Individuals within a group typically have their own unique beliefs, intentions, and perspectives.
 - Given the diversity of individual mental processes, it would be reasonable to expect that group-level views and decisions would be more chaotic and incoherent.
2. Lack of central control:
 - Groups are often decentralized, with no single entity or individual controlling the overall direction and decision-making.
 - Without a centralized authority, the emergence of coherent group-level outcomes is puzzling and counterintuitive.
3. Potential for conflict:
 - With individuals holding different beliefs and intentions, there is inherent potential for conflict and divergence within the group.
 - The fact that groups are able to overcome these conflicts and arrive at coherent views is unexpected.
4. Complexity of social interactions:
 - The interactions and dynamics within a group involve a multitude of factors, including communication, emotional contagion, and social influence.
 - The complexity of these social processes makes the emergence of coherent group-level phenomena seem unlikely.
5. Deviation from individual behavior:
 - At the individual level, people may exhibit more chaotic or unpredictable behavior.
 - The fact that these individual-level tendencies can coalesce into coherent group-level views is counterintuitive and requires explanation.
This coherence observed in groups deviates from what one would expect based on individual-level processes. 

Explaining this phenomenon requires understanding the mechanisms and processes that enable the integration of individual mental states into collective, coherent views and decisions.

By delving into the underlying mechanisms, such as theory of mind, internal simulation, and shared emotional experiences, this research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how infusing AI into social processes can lead to the emergence of coherent group-level phenomena, which may initially seem unexpected or surprising.
